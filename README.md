RiTa functions to play with text
# workshop task
had a lot of fun playing with text generation. I liked the rhyme one we were introduced to in the workshop, and well as the noun replacer so i kept those two functions for my own task. I used the randomWord function and added parameters for syllables and word length because i wanted to have some really long and fancy words generated, especially because i had a fancy font, and the long words made it seem more nonsensical. it worked well and i think it is my favourite function so far. I randomised the text colour just to make it flashy and fun.
